# NAnderson_FYP_2019

### This repository contains the Python code for the final year project of Nick Anderson (ANDNIC019) prepared for the University of Cape Town.

The folders are structured to show the different modeling methods used for the project: The hybrid dynamics method, "Hybrid Method" and the contact-implicit method, "Complementarity Method". The "Bouncing Ball" folder shows the development phases of the individual aspects of the system.

### Install Guide

In order to run the notebooks, the following steps should be taken:

install anaconda
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

Open the Anaconda Prompt

\> conda install -c conda-forge pyomo

\> conda install -c conda-forge pyomo.extras

\> conda install -c conda-forge ipopt

\> conda install jupyter numpy matplotlib sympy

\> conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg

(might need to update some of the libraries. I needed to update matplotlib to use the arrow function)
