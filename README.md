# NAnderson_FYP_2019

### This repository contains the Python code for the final year project of Nick Anderson (ANDNIC019) prepared for the University of Cape Town.

The folders are structured to show the different modeling methods used for the project: The hybrid dynamics method, "Hybrid Method" and the contact-implicit method, "Complementarity Method". The "Bouncing Ball" folder shows the development phases of the individual aspects of the system.
