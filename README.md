# NAnderson_FYP_2019

### This repository contains the Python code and report for the final year project of Nick Anderson (ANDNIC019) prepared for the University of Cape Town.

The folders are structured as follows:

* The "Complementarity Method" folder includes the Python scripts used to develop the system to perform the ollie using the contact-implicit method.

* The "Bouncing Ball" folder shows the development phases of the individual aspects of the system.

### Install Guide

In order to run the notebooks, the following steps should be taken:

1. Install Anaconda

https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

2. Install libraries using Anaconda

Open the Anaconda Prompt

\> conda install -c conda-forge pyomo

\> conda install -c conda-forge pyomo.extras

\> conda install -c conda-forge ipopt

\> conda install jupyter numpy matplotlib sympy

\> conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg

\> conda install cloudpickle

(might need to update some of the libraries. I needed to update matplotlib to use the arrow function)
